# K-Means-clustering
It is method of unsupervised machine learning algorithm in which we group a set of objects based on their similarities. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.The K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids,and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster,while keeping the ccentroids as small as possible.This algorithm works in following way. 

1)Pick a value for k (the number of clusters to create). 

2)Initialize k ‘centroids’ (starting points) in your data. 

3)Create your clusters. Assign each point to the nearest centroid. 

4)Make your clusters better. Move each centroid to the center of its cluster. 

5)Repeat steps 3–4 until your centroids converge. 

Here we have performed this algorithm on standard Iris dataset.
